📊 Delivery Route Performance Analysis
Objective

Analyze delivery route performance data to identify patterns in delays and provide recommendations for operational improvements.

Background

This project is inspired by real-world operational workflows involving delivery routes and time-based performance metrics. The goal is to demonstrate foundational data analysis skills using realistic data.

Data

The dataset is simulated to reflect realistic operational delivery patterns.

Simulated delivery route dataset including:

Route ID

Delivery date

Distance

Delivery time

Delay indicator

Tools Used

SQL (data querying and aggregation)

Excel (data cleaning, pivot tables, visualizations)

Process

Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values and standardizing formats

Queried data using SQL to group and summarize performance metrics

Analyzed trends in delivery time and delays

Created Excel visualizations to highlight key insights

Used SQL to aggregate delivery time and delay metrics by route and delivery status.

Key Insights

Excel charts were created to visualize average delivery time by route and the proportion of delayed vs on-time deliveries.

Some routes consistently showed longer delivery times

Delays occurred more frequently on high-distance routes

Route reassignment could improve overall efficiency

What I Learned

How to structure a simple data analysis project

How to clean and validate operational data

How to communicate insights clearly using visualizations

Next Steps

Expand analysis with additional variables

Build an interactive dashboard

Apply similar analysis to other operational datasets
